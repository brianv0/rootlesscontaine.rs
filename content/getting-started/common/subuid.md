Rootless Containers implementations mostly expect `/etc/subuid` to contain at least 65,536 subuids.

In the following example, 65,536 subuids (100000-165535) are allocated for a user named "user1".

```console
$ cat /etc/subuid
user1:100000:65536
```

The same applies to subgids defined in `/etc/subgid`. See also [How it works/User Namespaces](/how-it-works/userns/).

These subuids and subgids are typically automatically configured by the system.

If subuids and subgids are not configured, you need to edit `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` directly with a text editor:

```console
$ sudo vi /etc/subuid
```

Pre-generating all possible values for /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid, based on uid and gid, rather than the user 
and group names, is also possible. This can simplify shared management of shared computing environments
using LDAP/AD, while there is no standardized way to store or retrieve subuid and subgid values
from those directories.

An example python program to generate the files:

```python
f = open("/etc/subuid", "w")
for uid in range(1000, 65536):
    f.write("%d:%d:65536\n" %(uid,uid*65536))
f.close()

f = open("/etc/subgid", "w")
for uid in range(1000, 65536):
    f.write("%d:%d:65536\n" %(uid,uid*65536))
f.close()
```

When doing this, however, it's important to note that duplicate entries will be added to the files
when adding new local users, through based on user name or group name.

## newuidmap and newgidmap

`newuidmap` and `newgidmap` needs to be installed on the host.
These binaries are typically installed by default.

{{< tabs "uidmap" >}}
{{< tab "apt-get" >}}

```console
$ sudo apt-get install -y uidmap
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "dnf" >}}

```console
$ sudo dnf install -y shadow-utils
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}
